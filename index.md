<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Postdoc Reseracher at [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) and [Notre Dame Environmental Change Initiative (ND-ECI)](https://environmentalchange.nd.edu/), working under the mentorship of Dr. [Kyle Doudrick](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/kyle-doudrick/). I was graduate from [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca) in Chemical Engineering, with Dr. [Christopher Lan](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/department-chemical-and-biological-engineering/directory/christopher-lan). My reserach is particular emphasis on two key areas: the application of membrane separation and co-precipitation techniques for the removal of heavy metal ions & PFAS, and the innovative use of microalgae as an adsorbent for heavy metal ion & PFAS adsorption and removal.

## Research Interest:

- **Microalgae:** Cultivation, Nutruient removal, Harvesting
- **Membrane:** Fabrication, Morphology, Flitration
- **Heavy metal:** Characterization, Removal, Migration
- **PFAS:** Regulation, Detection
- **Neuromorphic Computing with Eviromental Engineering:** Neuromorphic Sensing and Perception, Hybrid Computing Systems, Brain-Inspired Robotics
